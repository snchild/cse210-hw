This program is intended to help someone schedule out their week. Someone can create an event, cancel an event,
display all the information for an event, check the time (which follows through on each event), and save and
load a schedule. The testing.txt file has an event of each type, which is handy for going through each option
without having to create the events first.

Something to notice is that I have made it so the events are chronilogically sorted. That was one way that I 
showed creativity and went above and beyond. Another way I showed creativity is in the CheckTime function.
Not only do I follow through on the events that have passed, but I also give the user a heads up on the next
event that is coming up.
